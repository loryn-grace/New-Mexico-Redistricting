# New-Mexico-Redistricting
This Repository is a class project for Operations Research (IEM 4013) at Oklahoma State University.
Students were asked to use 2020 Census data to draw optimal congressional districts of a state. My group selected New Mexico.

The instructor of this course is Dr. Austin Buchanan. His Repository can be found here: https://github.com/AustinLBuchanan/Districting-Examples.

Included in the repository is census data for New Mexico, our codes, and our report.
