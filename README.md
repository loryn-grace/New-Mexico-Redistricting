# New-Mexico-Redistricting
This Repository is a class project for Operations Research (IEM 4013) at Oklahoma State University.
Students were asked to use 2020 Census data to draw optimal congressional districts of a state. My group selected New Mexico.

Included in the repository is census data for New Mexico, our codes, and our report.
